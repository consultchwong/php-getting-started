<strong class="t">What method do you use for circumcision?	</strong><br><br>
We use the Laser CO2 method & Forceps Guided method. Please refer to the Procedures page for more information.	
	<br>
	<br>
<strong class="t">What is the average time to recovery?	</strong><br><br>
We recommend 2-3 days rest after circumcision by Laser CO2 method while a week's by Forceps Guided method.

<strong class="t">What is the recommended age for circumcising a child?	</strong><br><br>
We recommend that a child is circumcised between the ages of 1-3 months old. At this age, the infant would feel minimal pain and the healing process will be quicker. An infant will also have little movement at this age.	</span>
