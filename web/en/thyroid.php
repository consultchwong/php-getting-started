            <br />
        Circumcision<span class="style3"> is very common which is a great way to protect yourself or your baby son throughout life. Surgical removal  of foreskin significantly reduces the risks of developing the following unpleasant illnesses: <br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight: bold">Urinary tract infections</span><br>
			<br>
			Circumcision helps prevent urinary tract infections in both males and their female partners.It is a documented fact that uncircumcised males are 10 times more likely to come down with a urinary track infection than circumcised males.  <br>
			<br>
				
			<span style="font-weight: bold">Balanitis </span><br>
			<br>
			Balanitis is an unpleasant, often recurring, inflammation of the glans. It is quite common and can be prevented by circumcision.<br>
			<br>
				
			<span style="font-weight: bold">STDs </span><br>
			<br>
			Studies in recent years have shown that the percentage of    sexually transmitted diseases are lower in circumcised males. This is   due to the fact that the foreskin causes an environment conducive to   germs if germs are introduced. <br>
			<br>
				
			<span style="font-weight: bold">HIV/AIDS </span><br>
			<br>
			Protection against HIV and AIDS. An<em>British Medical  Journal</em> article in May 2000 suggested that circumcised men  are 8 times less likely to contract the HIV virus. (It is very  important here to say that the risk is still far too high and  that condoms and safe sex must be used) <br>
			<br>
				
			<span style="font-weight: bold">Cancer of the penis	</span><br>
			<br>
			Studies have shown a higher rate of penile cancer among men who   were not circumcised as infants. about 1  in 1000 - fairly rare, but tragic if you or your son are in that  small statistic. Infant circumcision gives almost 100% protection,  and young adult circumcision also gives a large degree of protection.<br>
			<br>
				
			<span style="font-weight: bold">Prepuce(Tight Foreskin) </span><br>
			<br>
			Circumsicion is the solution for Prepuce(Tight Foreskin) and frenulum problems. <br>
